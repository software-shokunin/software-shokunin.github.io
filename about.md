As aspiring Software Shokunin we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

* Not only working software : **but also well-crafted software**
* Not only responding to change : **but also steadily adding value**
* Not only individuals and interactions : **but also a community of professionals**
* Not only customer collaboration : **but also productive partnerships**

That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.

*Borrowed from the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)*
